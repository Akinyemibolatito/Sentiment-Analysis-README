# Sentiment Analysis README

## Overview
This README file provides an overview of the sentiment analysis project conducted on a dataset containing customer reviews. The analysis involved exploring the dataset, performing sentiment classification, and evaluating the performance of the sentiment classifier.

## Analysis Process
1. **Data Exploration (EDA)**:
   - Explored the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
   - Checked for missing values, data types, and distributions of categorical variables.
   - Visualized the distributions of star ratings, helpful votes, and total votes.
   
2. **Sentiment Classification**:
   - Used machine learning techniques to classify the sentiment of customer reviews.
   - Trained a sentiment classifier using features extracted from the review text.
   - Evaluated the performance of the classifier using various metrics.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Generated a classification report to assess the performance of the sentiment classifier.
   - Calculated accuracy and other relevant metrics to evaluate the model's performance.
   - Analyzed precision, recall, and F1-score for each sentiment class.

## Final Results
- **Accuracy**: 0.8799
- **Classification Report**:

weighted avg       0.85      0.88      0.86      6170
  ```

## Conclusion
The sentiment analysis project successfully classified customer reviews into sentiment categories (negative, neutral, positive) with an accuracy of 0.8799. The classifier performed well in identifying positive sentiment reviews, achieving a high precision, recall, and F1-score. However, the performance was relatively lower for neutral and negative sentiment reviews, indicating potential areas for improvement.
